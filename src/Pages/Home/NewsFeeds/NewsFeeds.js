      description: `The "Think in a Redux way" course mainly emphasizes project-based teaching methods. Throughout the course many projects are presented and given as assignments. Since this is a front-end course and focused on state management and redux, we will provide the back-end and APIs for each project. The student just needs to use them in the front end and manage the state properly. Some such projects are shown in the video.
      If you want to take full advantage of this course's project-based teaching method and take your skills to the next level, enroll in our Redux course now instead of waiting until the last day for a discount.`,
